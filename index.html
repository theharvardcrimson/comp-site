      <p>As Harvard&#39;s financially and editorially independent student newspaper, The Crimson&#39;s reporting has had a profound impact on campus life. Just this year, The Crimson has unveiled a <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/31/hupd-investigation/">racist and sexist</a> environment within the Harvard University Police Department, brought to light <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/29/harvard-anthropology-gender-issues/">allegations</a> of sexual misconduct against three Anthropology professors, and reported on how COVID-19 has impacted <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-fgli-student-concerns/">students</a>, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/12/harvard-coronavirus-quincy-huds-cases/">staff</a>, and <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/15/ice-lawsuit-policy-rescinded/">university life</a> more broadly. </p>
      <p>By holding those in power accountable and striving for truth above all else, The Crimson is committed to informing and educating our readers on the latest news from campus - even during a global pandemic.</p>
      <p>The Crimson is also a training ground for the next generation of journalists, public servants, and business leaders.</p> 
      <p>Our prominent alumni include U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt &rsquo;1904 and John F. Kennedy &rsquo;40; 30 Pulitzer prize-winners including Nicholas D. Kristof &rsquo;81, Linda Greenhouse &rsquo;68, David Sanger &rsquo;82, and Susan C. Faludi &rsquo;81; and titans of business, media, and technology, such as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer &rsquo;77, YouTube CEO Susan D. Wojcicki &rsquo;90, and Mad Money host Jim Cramer &rsquo;77 just to name a few.</p>
      <p>The Crimson has substantial reach as a newspaper and a company. Its million-dollar business. Its website, in 2020, got {{ site.yearly_page_views_millions }} million pageviews. Its Financial Aid Program that has given out close to $1 million over the past decade to Crimson staffers. Its lasting friendships and vibrant community.</p>

      <h3>FINANCIAL AID</h3>
      <p>Worried that you won&#39;t be able to spend time on The Crimson because you think you&#39;ll need a paying job? We can help. The Crimson&#39;s Financial Aid Program offers limited but substantial compensation to staff members with demonstrated financial need. It&#39;s meant to ensure that students who would otherwise need a term-time job can be Crimson editors, and it&#39;s part of our efforts to make sure that all Harvard students have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from the experience of working here, regardless of their socioeconomic background.</p>
      <p>Any questions? Want more information? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact Crimson President {{ site.president }} (<a href="mailto:president@thecrimson.com">president@thecrimson.com</a>) with any and all questions about the program.</p>
