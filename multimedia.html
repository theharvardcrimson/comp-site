        A picture is worth a thousand words. We at Multimedia are committed to bringing The Crimson to life with our photo, video, and podcast content. The 1,000+ photos we publish each year fill the online and print pages of the News, Sports, Arts, and FM boards. Our videos air on YouTube and Instagram, where they received more than 1 million combined views last year, and they have been featured on other sources such as Time, Fox News, Business Insider, The Huffington Post, and Boston Magazine. Our award-winning flagship news podcast, <i>Newstalk</i>, publishes weekly to thousands of listeners across the country and world. As The Crimson moves towards a digital-first future, Multimedia journalism is the core of the operation, and we are continuing to expand our reach into new online and interactive content.
