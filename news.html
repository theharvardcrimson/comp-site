        The News Board is the heart and soul of The Crimson. From the College&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-fgli-student-concerns/">unprecedented decision</a> to send all students home during the coronavirus outbreak to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/29/how-to-get-in-to-harvard/">the admissions lawsuit</a> against Harvard which has implications for the fate of affirmative action nationwide, the Crimson News Board is frequently at the center of campus conversations. We receive early access to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/4/7/harvard-admissions-2025/">admissions data</a> and conduct exclusive interviews with <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/9/23/bacow-on-harvard-divestment/">Harvard&rsquo;s top administrators</a>. Writers get to see their bylines run in our daily newspaper and on our award-winning website which receives more than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/8/27/incoming-freshman-deported/">{{ site.monthly_page_views_millions }} million page views per month</a>. We are a committed, close-knit community that extends from our undergraduate days to long past graduation.

        News is a home not just for aspiring journalists, but for anyone who wants to speak truth to power, amplify marginalized voices, and make a difference on campus. A number of our stories have garnered campus-wide — and even nation-wide — attention, ultimately pushing the administration to make changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our writers learn how to ask the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/13/hsph-administration-concerns/">right questions and get answers</a>. They learn how to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/31/hupd-investigation/">investigate and organize facts into writing</a>. <strong>No previous experience in journalism is necessary</strong>: the comp process is designed to provide students with all the skills necessary for becoming a reporter.
