        The News Board is the heart and soul of The Crimson. We scooped that <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/3/claudine-gay-resign-harvard/">Claudine Gay would be resigning</a>, beating national outlets to the story. We scooped them before, too, when we announced that Harvard’s top board <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/12/gay-stays-in-office-corporation-support/">would support her</a> a few weeks earlier. From <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/6/29/affirmative-action-falls/">the Supreme Court’s decision on affirmative action</a> against Harvard which has national implications to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/6/17/harvard-police-arrests-data/">hard-hitting metro coverage</a>, the Crimson News Board is frequently at the center of campus conversations. We receive early access to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/14/early-action-2028/">admissions data</a> and conduct exclusive interviews with <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/8/gay-apology-congressional-remarks/">Harvard&rsquo;s top administrators</a> — and the world always listens. You will cover Harvard’s most consequential presidential search in decades and pull back the curtain on that secretive process. Writers get to see their bylines run in our newspaper and on our award-winning website which receives more than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/10/psc-statement-backlash/">{{ site.monthly_page_views_millions }} million page views per month</a>. We are a committed, close-knit community that extends from our undergraduate days to long past graduation.

        News is a home not just for aspiring journalists, but for anyone who wants to speak truth to power, amplify marginalized voices, and make a difference on campus. A number of our stories have garnered campus-wide — and even nation-wide — attention, ultimately pushing the administration to make changes.

      <p>
        Our writers learn how to ask the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/9/29/humanities-proposal-fas-harvard/">right questions and get answers</a>. They learn how to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/5/10/winthrop-climate/">investigate and organize facts into writing</a>. <strong>No previous experience in journalism is necessary</strong>: the comp process is designed to provide students with all the skills necessary for becoming a reporter. <strong>We cannot emphasize this enough: no previous experience required!</strong>

        By Ema R. Schumer <br>
        <i>For the most part, Harvard affiliates know Harvard University police officers as the men and women who patrol campus events, frequent the dining halls, and help freshmen move into their dorms. Within the department&rsquo;s walls, though, HUPD is divided over incidents involving female officers and officers of color, and allegations of favoritism and retaliation.</i>
