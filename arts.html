        Seething about the anticlimactic ending of a masterful show? Eager to break down an incendiary pop culture moment? Excited about an upcoming concert with your favorite musician? Arts is the board for you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Arts Board of The Crimson teems with cinephiles and book lovers, TV aficionados, and theater enthusiasts. Broadly speaking, however, Arts is a board for anyone who cares deeply about what we see, watch, and hear, and anyone who wants to use art as a way of reflecting on our world and shaping vital civic conversations. </p>
      <p>
        Our coverage encompasses topics including <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/7/20/josh-scherer-chef-mythical-last-meal-youtube/"> pop culture icons</a>,

        Aside from being a part of the wonderful, idiosyncratic, and outrageously witty community that is the Arts Board, there are
         plenty of other perks to comping as well! Our writers have attended the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/topic/cannes-film-festival-2023/"> Cannes Film Festival </a>,
        sat down to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/20/casa-de-mi-padre-ferrell/"> interview Will 
         Ferrell </a>, and regularly get tickets to advance movie screenings, music performances, and guest speaker events — all free of charge.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We, like all Crimson boards, welcome everyone regardless of prior journalism experience. Our comp is designed to teach you everything you will need to know as a writer, from interviewing techniques to crafting the perfect lede. All you need to do is show up—and write!
      <p>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px; text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</h4>
        We&#39;ll go over all of these at our first meeting, but in case you&#39;re curious, here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to complete in order to become a writer for Crimson Arts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 reviews (evaluative pieces on movies, albums, books, theater, exhibits, and more)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 feature (longer pieces that do not fall under the category of criticism—e.g., event coverage)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 profile (longer, interview-driven pieces featuring an artist or cultural figure)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 think piece (research-based, argumentative pieces)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 additional article for Arts
          </li>
          <li>
            One of the required pieces must be self-pitched, and one must be metro-based (local coverage outside of Harvard&#39;s campus)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Articles are pitched out by editors at our weekly Writers&#39; Meetings, which take place on Mondays at 7 p.m.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to writing articles and attending Writers&#39; Meetings, compers must attend our weekly comp seminars at 6 p.m. on Mondays(i.e., directly before Writers&#39; Meetings). At these seminars we&#39;ll teach you everything you need to know about arts writing, even if you have never written a complete sentence.

        Comping another board as well? Talk to your comp directors to learn more about our policies that may lessen your Arts comp requirements.

      <p>
        Did you start comping Arts but got distracted? Don&#39;t sweat it. We&#39;ve kept track of everything you&#39;ve already written and the articles still count towards your comp. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For those of you returning from a prior semester to complete your comp: Come back soon. We miss you.
